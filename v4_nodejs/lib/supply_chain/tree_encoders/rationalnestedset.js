  Quarry.io Rational Nested Set Tree Encoder
  ------------------------------------------

	* Rational Nested Set Tree Encoder for Jquarry
	*
	* This Library is responsible for creating the [Rational Number](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_number)
	* keys for the nested set algorithm used by the Tree Storage Driver.
	*
	* The premise is that the left boundary of the [Nested Set Model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nested_set_model)
	* is calculated as a rational number based upon a [Continued Fraction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continued_fraction)
	* which uses an alternate sequence of relative node position and unity as it's values.
	*
	* The right boundary is assumed to be the left boundary of the nodes immediate sibling - this results in being able
	* to retrieve descendants and ancestors of a node with one SQL hit.
	*
	* Each boundary is represented as 2 integers - the numerator and denominator of the rational number and each node
	* will contain it's own numerator and denominator (as the left boundary) and that of it's immediate sibling (as the right boundary).
	*
	* This means if:
	*
	*		ln = left numerator, ld = left denominator
	*
	*		rn = right numerator, rd = right denominator
	*
	* then all descendants of this node can be retrieved using:
	*
	*		( this.ln / this.ld ) < ( descendant.ln / descendant.ld ) < ( this.rn / this.rd )
	*
	* and all ancestors of this node can be retrieved using:
	*
	*		( ancestor.ln / ancestor.ld ) < ( this.ln / this.ld ) < ( ancestor.rn / ancestor.rd )
	*
	* More importantly - inserting a new node into the tree becomes far more efficient because there are infinite rational numbers
	* that lie BETWEEN ( this.ln / this.ld ) and ( this.rn / this.rd )
	*
	* Using the classic nested set left and right singular values - an average of n/2 updates needed to be made just to insert one node!
	*
	* Using this method - a the left and right keys for a descendant can be calculated and are guaranteed to fall within the left and right 
	* boundaries of the parent node without having to affect the rest of the tree - making inserts a factor of 1 rather than averaging n/2.
	*
	* This is based upon the stirling work done by Dan Hazel (dan hazel@technologyonecorp.com) in his paper
	* [Using rational numbers to key nested sets](http://arxiv.org/abs/0806.3115) - all credit due to him : )
	*
	* This library makes use of the gmp extenstion to do large number arithmetic and and will return strings of those numbers
	* this is because larger numbers will fall over (32-bit limitations) and so we will pass these string values into MySQL
	* which will use the decimal field type to do it's internal calculations
	*
