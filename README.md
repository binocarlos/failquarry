# quarry fail

An example of how not to do it 6 times over

Each one gets better than the last

up to version 0.1 of quarry.io

Prepare yourself for utter disappointment in some basic design
principles followed by massive displays of tenacity and
persistence.

All this in order to then get it wrong again, and again : )
